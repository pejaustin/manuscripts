            I sucked in poison breaths, the toxic air rejuvenating me and
          tiring me in equal measures. I looked down at the temple of
          Meteora, the place I once called home. I never thought I'd leave
          the temple grounds--its swaying moss-trees, its pools of purple
          air-sanctifying sprites--nor did I ever want to. But now, in a
          darkness punctuated by far off flames, like the embers of a dying
          bonfire, I redoubled my resolve to leave. I am not the boy I once
          was--or at least I will have to leave him behind too, if I want
          to survive in the lilac wilds of Risha alone.
            I turn to the wagon behind me, filled with scraps of metal and
          scintillating colored lights which broke from the black star. I
          reached into my pocket, and touched the ancient book I held
          secret there. Words come to mind, an old prayer we were taught to
          speak as a ward against the karmic evil in the air here on Risha,
          our cursed planet. I don't believe in the words anymore, but I
          say them anyway.

            I thrummed the strings of my sitar, worn from the use of dozens
          of apprentices before me, and melted into the melody the other
          go-rhythm players were coaxing to life. The drums, the abacus,
          the beads of sand on the floor; everything in the universe seemed
          like it was in its right place--or more like we were putting
          everything into place, setting the stage for a world to come. The
          sun was setting behind us, and a rally of little stars streaked
          across the sky as night fell. I always felt happy to see
          Meteora's gifts--like they were my kin. I imagined flying through
          the cool night air, then shook the vision from my mind--that kind
          of fantasy is for children, not for those ready to be initiated
          into the priesthood. Just over the horizon, where the orange sky
          began to darken, the bright light of the star-home could be
          seen--far off like a wish. Just above it, the constellation of
          the warrior, Enya, and somewhere inside it, the home-world I'd
          visited only in my dreams.
            When, finally, the playing ended, I bowed to the abacus at the
          center of the temple stage as I'd been taught to do. Lifting my
          head, I noticed I was the only one doing so.
            "Panic not," father said. "We must confer, and confirm the
          calculations." He rose from his seated position, putting his
          sitar gingerly back in the crook of its stand--the other priests
          skittering after him into the inner sanctum of the temple like
          kittens after their mother.
            I looked out at a small sea of worried faces on the wives,
          husbands, and children of our family Had I missed something? I
          looked at mother in the crowd, as I always did when I was unsure
          how to act.
            "You heard Ashur-Pola-Ishkun," she said to the crowd, avoiding
          my gaze. She began to usher people away from the temple stage.
          "No need to waste the night-turn."
            It was like she had lifted an invisible cork from a bottle of
          uneasiness, and a fog of chatter began to rise out of the crowd
          as they dispersed. I looked at the abacus. I knew enough about
          the go-rhythms to be able to read the divination, and when I did,
          a jolt of panic seized me. There would be no starfall for six
          months.

            Night-turn eve was my time to do house-chores with mother, but
          as soon as the heavy cloth wrappings of day came off, being stuck
          inside was the last thing I wanted to do. The sun's demons didn't
          mark your skin with the slow death during the night, and the
          freedom of night-robes always woke in me the urge to run down the
          mountainside with long strides, imagining I were a star bringing
          the gift of water to the valley. This night-turn, I was
          distracted by a different urge--chores could wait until
          night-turn morn, the twice-long days of Risha gave us plenty of
          darkness to work with. I waited outside the temple as father and
          the other priests talked inside, and tried to understand what was
          happening. It was hard to imagine what drought would be like, but
          I didn't want anything bad to happen to the people of Irkallu
          valley below, especially to Kiem. Finally, I heard movement
          behind the large wooden statue of Meteora.
            "What if word gets out?" I heard a voice say. A group of
          priests shuffled down the stairs of the temple stage, led by
          father.
            "And who would tell, Inya-Va," another said.
            "It is a risk. We should find a way to contact the star-home,
          as--"
            "There is always risk," father interrupted, stopping to turn to
          them. "We are prepared for such disasters. We must heed the
          Outcomes."
            Father noticed me as he said this--I had been inching closer
          unconsciously.
            "Sar-Il," he said. I searched his face for signs of disdain or
          judgment, and found none.
            "What will we do, father?" I asked. "When will we tell the
          valley-folk about the drought?"
            My aunt and uncle exchanged looks with father that I couldn't
          figure out. "We will not tell them,"  father said, "until it is
          clear what will truly come to pass."
            "Would it help if I performed an offering?" I said.
            Father smiled like it took every ounce of energy he had to make
          the muscles in his face move. "Sin-Sar-Ilani," he said. "My son
          has a good heart. You will make a great addition to the
          priesthood once we bring you through the rites."
            The adults walked with weighted shoulders back to the
          apartments, leaving me alone and dumbfounded by the temple stage.
          Something wasn't right about their reaction to the divination. It
          was our duty to divine Meteora's gifts, but it almost seemed like
          father and the others treated this omen like a danger to them
          personally, not to the whole colony. Father was high priest,
          though, and my initiation was still a few months away. There must
          have been something I was unaware of, some secret facet of the
          rites that was as yet hidden to me.
            Even as I resolved to trust father, I couldn't help seeing
          Kiem's face in my mind. Once, when we had gone to the town to
          collect grain and dried sprites, Kiem and I had played Slay The
          Raider while our father's conducted business. Neither of us had
          cared how much the air hurt us while we played, and I had coughed
          so much coming back up the mountain that my chest was sore the
          rest of the twice-long day. From then on, Kiem had accompanied
          his father up the mountain pass anytime he and the other
          valley-folk came to the temple for business or for prayer. He was
          the only person I knew who wasn't part of the family. Father
          encouraged us being friends, but I felt others in the priesthood
          family staring at us whenever we played or went scavenging for
          sweet-grubs.
            I was stuck in place worried what would happen to Kiem and his
          father when the last of the priests filtered out of the
          courtyard, crowded around Uncle Ili. I saw something in the eyes
          of my uncle and those who walked with him, whispering--almost
          like hunger. It was like they were a pack of mountain dogs
          waiting for their old and tired alpha to be weakened enough for a
          joint attack, ousting him for good.
            Cousin Mubal was with his father. He noticed me and walked
          over, putting his arm over my shoulder. He was only a few years
          older than me, but I nearly buckled under his weight. He pulled
          me along with him back to the family apartments.
            "What did you think of the divination today?" he said.
            "What do you mean?" I asked.
            He shrugged. "Did anything stand out to you?"
            "I... suppose it was odd how long it took," I said.
            His laugh cut into my soul. It confirmed that we both knew I
          wasn't ready yet.
            "Yes, it did go on long," he said, "perhaps because mistakes
          were made in the early rounds. Story right now is: that's
          probably all this is--a fluke." He winked, and smacked my
          shoulder hard, as if trying to jam the realization into me.
            I thought about his words, but I didn't understand. Uninitiated
          though I was, the go-rhythms came easily to me, and I knew no
          mistake had been made. He meant to encourage me with this talk,
          but I only felt further distanced from him, like I had
          accidentally walked into one of the mushroom caves on the
          outskirts of the temple grounds.
            "You pay too little attention to the ways of the world, Sar-Il"
          he said when I didn't answer him. Then he patted me lightly on
          the back and went on ahead, trailing after his father.
            What cousin Mubal said was untrue, and I only questioned
          whether or not he knew how obviously it was so. Why was everyone
          in the family acting strangely? These questions and more rotted
          in me like fruit in the grass. Grandmother Nel had once told me
          that rot takes hold quickly on Risha than it had on the
          home-world, she said it was because of the 'unfinished' air. The
          air was being purified by Meteora, that was why we were here.
          Once a year, after the summer, father measures the karmic level
          of the air before the whole colony, and we celebrate with sweets
          and pastries that I crave for months afterwards but mother
          refuses to make. For some reason, the fond memories of our holy
          days did little to cheer me now.
            I entered our home to see mother and father in the tea room, he
          was helping her position cushions around her legs and back--she
          was pregnant, and the weight of it was increasing every day. I
          walked by without a word, and went straight to bed. I trusted
          father, but I couldn't sleep. I kept imagining Kiem walking to
          the Starlight River, finding it dry, and collapsing at it's muddy
          banks.

            A full-turn after the divination, a group of valley-folk,
          including Kiem and his father, came up the mountain pass to give
          offerings and to receive the divination of Meteora's will. Father
          didn't let me play with them this time, since I wasn't officially
          part of the priesthood yet, but I sat eagerly near the stage with
          mother, and watched the skillful work of the more seasoned
          players. Then something strange happened. They made a mistake. Or
          really, a few mistakes. I looked at father, sure that he would
          have noticed as well, but he just kept playing the go-rhythm as
          it was. I figured I had imagined it, but soon the divination was
          over, and the result showed starfall in three twice-long days,
          with a secondary symbol depicting which constellation the stars
          would come from. The icon was of a handcart, pulled by a donkey.
          Like all the other constellations, they didn't really look much
          like the still-stars that made them up. The valley-folk seemed
          satisfied, and presented their offerings of a goat and ten woven
          baskets of sephra, the milled flour made of grain mixed with
          dried algae.
            The valley-folk stayed for a while, chatting and having
          fortune-divinations done. Kiem came over to me as soon as the
          adults dispersed, and I was glad to be wearing my daytime
          wrappings--I didn't want my friend to notice how strange I felt.
          He noticed soon enough anyway.
            "What's with you?" he asked.
            "What do you mean?" I said.
            "You haven't checked any rocks yet."
            "I'm not hungry," I said, which was true--even though I hadn't
          had my daybreak meal. I was too busy trying to think through
          everything that was going on.
            Kiem soon ran off to join his father. I felt worse after he
          left, I hadn't meant to drag his mood down with my own. I thought
          about telling him about the divination I had helped with, and how
          the new one had made mistakes. Father said priest business was
          for priests only, but now I struggled to imagine any hidden
          knowledge could really explain all the odd things going on.
            Three twice-long days went by, no starfall came, and so neither
          did rain. Valley-folk came back, worried. Father received them,
          and I hid, ashamed to show myself to Kiem, though I wasn't sure
          why. They were welcomed warmly, explanations were given,
          offerings were burned, and a new divination was made.
            This happened three more times. Each time, the valley-folk were
          more flustered, begging and wailing. The Starlight River was
          reduced to a stream, and some of the animals were starting to
          perish in the growing heat of summer. What seemed strangest to me
          was that with each divination, some of the players made mistakes.
          That first time, it had seemed like an accident. But when I paid
          closer attention, I realized that the mistakes were made at
          particular moments that hinged the result to within a certain
          margin. I calculated alternative routes of melodies from the
          shoulder of the temple, and tried to work out the abacus result
          in my mind. Without the mistake, I was certain that the result of
          the divinations were still leading to the date originally
          foretold, away from uninitiated eyes, weeks ago.
            I didn't want to believe father was a liar. There could still
          be something I was missing--nearly to the point of praying for
          that to be the case. I decided I'd confront him, and waited for
          our night-turn meal to speak to father, away from his brother and
          cousins. I hoped that alone with me and mother--who had a way of
          getting through my father's stubbornness--I would be able to coax
          out of him a reasonable explanation.
            "We've had a lot of missed falls in a row." I said, between
          bites of mushroom stew.
            "Yes," he said, "Meteora may be testing us for some purpose."
            "Do you remember the divination we had a month ago? When I
          played with the family?"
            His face didn't change, but he turned the stew over with his
          spoon instead of bringing a bite to his lips. He didn't answer.
            "It's just--I noticed some of the players, not that they aren't
          playing well, but they make mistakes. Maybe that divination
          was--"
            "There are no mistakes." He said. "And don't say any of this to
          that boy you hang out with, understood?"
            "Yes father."
            I felt like there was something in the room with us, a shadowy
          presence without a name. I looked at mother instinctively. Maybe
          she noticed it to. She grabbed my hand.
            "Have you been playing your offering songs? Practicing the
          arithmetic scales?" she said.
            "Yes." I was trying so hard to hide the warble in my voice that
          it was almost a whisper.
            "Then perhaps Lady Meteora will listen."
            We continued to eat our meal in silence. After some time,
          father spoke up again.
            "We need more time to understand her message," he said. "You
          will understand all of this when you are older. We live in a
          dangerous world, Sar-Il."
            I nodded half-heartedly, and was going to excuse myself for the
          night, but then I remembered Kiem, and how we had advised his
          father to plant seedlings two weeks ago. Seeds that would wither
          and die if the divination was true. What would happen to them
          without food in the scorching summer heat?
            "What if the original date is true? Do the valley-folk have
          enough food to last that long?"
            "No, I don't think they do." Father looked straight at me, but
          betrayed no emotion in his words.
            "Then we should warn them! They need--"
            "Knowing may not help them, Sar-Il. It might make things
          worse."
            I had more thoughts in my head before, but the words died in my
          throat.
            "People do not always act as they should when they are scared,"
          he said when I only gapped at him like a mudfish dug up out of
          the Starlight River. "Yes, they may not have enough water, but
          sending them into a panic will not fix that. We will try to find
          a way to solve the problem without bringing disorder to the
          colony."
            "Then why don't we pray for rain, father?" I asked.
            "Sar-Il," he chided. "But we do pray for rain."
            "Only on the day-turns of eve, when valley-folk walk up the
          mountain pass to pray with us. Why are we not praying when they
          are not here?"
            Father hesitated, perhaps surprised that I'd noticed this. "We
          have been working during the rest of the time to decipher why the
          drought is happening. Sometimes prayers are no use if they aren't
          focusing on the right subject. The best thing we can do for the
          people of Irkallu, and for ourselves, is to wait. You will
          understand soon. Your birthday is at the end of summer. You will
          be initiated then, and your questions will be answered. Trust me
          until then no matter what happens, Sin-Sar-Ilani." He motioned to
          the sky with two fingers as he said my full name, the name
          Meteora knew me by.
            My birthday. The drought would be over by then. Kiem and his
          family could be dead, and who knows how many others, before I
          learn the truth. And what if the truth doesn't satisfy me? My
          father and my cousin may have believed me naive, but they mistook
          that for cowardly as well. If we did live in a dangerous world, I
          wanted to help. That night, as I had done every night for several
          weeks, I crept out of the house with a small lantern.
            As I walked through the brisk night air, I gazed out towards
          Irkallu valley. The night was dark, but I could see lights from
          the village. Many valley-folk chose to do their fieldwork by
          torchlight, so as not to be attacked by the sun's demons during
          the day. I knew Kiem and his father were among them, probably
          unknowingly washing the last remnants of their well-water over
          plants that wouldn't survive the month. Above them, starfalls
          danced across the sky, laughing at me as my cousin did. None of
          them would land close enough to land in our valley, to melt into
          clouds of water. Kiem and the other valley-folk worked hard to
          live. I wanted to do the same.

            Hidden among the statues and hanging strands of prayer-beads on
          the temple stage, I found my sitar waiting for me, already tuned.
          I put the lantern down next to the abacus, put a small rag
          between the strings and body of my instrument to muffle its
          sound, and began to play. Father knew I was playing offering
          songs, but he didn't know I was also replaying the starfall
          divination. No one would suspect me, since it wasn't possible to
          do alone--or so most thought. Ever since the ill omen of drought
          first came, I had practiced doing the go-rythms on my own; I
          close my eyes and calculate the drum-count in my head while
          playing the string portion, and then pause to record the result
          on the abacus. The process was meticulous, but I was getting
          faster at it. As I had gotten the hang of it, I had also realized
          I was right about the divinations we did for the valley-folk. The
          results I got was the same as the original divination a month
          ago--a drought until the end of summer. Worse yet, the result was
          the same every time; it didn't change every day like it did when
          father and the other priests played it. They were making
          mistakes, and it was on purpose. The more I pleaded with Meteora
          via my playing, the more I felt something closing in on me, some
          dark truth unspoken, lurking in the periphery of my vision like a
          hungry mountain dog.
            After finishing the divination--the result so familiar that I
          had nearly memorized it--I looked up at the massive statue of
          Meteora at the center of the temple room. Her wooden face looked
          menacing in the dim lantern-light. The statue's hair was up in a
          tight bun pinned by a bronze trident, and her hands were raised
          in a stern position of prayer. I looked past her, at the door
          built into the side of the stage. Beyond that door were the
          answers to the questions that haunted me. Grandmother Nel had
          told me once of a great drought early in her lifetime. She said
          that Meteora was angry with her brother's lack of devotion, and
          she had to take control of the priesthood from him when people of
          Irkallu valley began to die. She had warned me, when I began my
          training to join the priesthood many years ago, that had she
          ignored Meteora's messages, the entire colony would have
          perished--small and fragile as we are. I imagined Kiem's shaggy
          brown hair which was so unruly it poked out of even the most
          tightly wound head-wraps like the scruffy weeds that sprout after
          even the shortest of sprinkling rains. I imagined him wasting
          away, his hair falling out from malnourishment. I put my sitar
          away and walked up to the door. Would Meteora want me to act as
          grandmother Nel had, if father was misinterpreting her wishes? Or
          would she punish me for insubordination? No. My intentions were
          pure, and I only wanted to be sure that the same was true of
          father, and Uncle Ili, and Aunt Inya, and all the other priests.
          And most of all I wanted to protect Kiem and the other
          valley-folk. The lady of the little stars could not begrudge me
          for that.
            Past the door I found a dirt staircase leading down, and
          another room at the end of a dank hallway carved into the earth.
          I squinted against strange blue-white lights as I entered. The
          lights didn't flicker the way torches or candles do. As I got
          closer, I could see that the lights came from strange gray and
          black metal objects. I had seen things like this before--some of
          the holy artifacts that came from the star-home were made of
          these materials. I looked around the room and saw stacks of dusty
          books and loose papers. Most looked like they would fall apart as
          soon as I touched them. In the center of the room was a large
          wooden desk, and a thick tome laid out on it. A thin red ribbon
          dangled out from between the pages, and writing on the front of
          the book read The Family of Sarru-Gin. I opened it up to the page
          bookmarked by the ribbon, and recognized father's handwriting. It
          was some kind of journal, and father had written entries recently
          about the drought. We will be forced to venture out of the valley
          for water soon, but doing so might open old wounds in the family.
          I will do my best to keep the family united, but if it comes to
          that, better to split than to allow the total destruction of the
          house, or even of the whole colony. I was both relieved and
          alarmed by his words. Glad because my father did see that the
          drought was a real danger to us and to Irkallu valley--he was not
          ignoring it as I had feared. But seeing that he too considered
          the threat to be grave shook my resolve. Even though I had
          desperately pleaded with him to see the danger, I had secretly
          hoped I was wrong to believe it so. But what did he mean venture
          out for water? I had been taught that Meteora hallowed the water
          that blew into our valley, and that rain everywhere else was
          acid, as it was on the oceans.
            I gingerly leafed backwards through the pages, looking for more
          information. The entries went back through the years, past my own
          birth, and seemed to be written by whoever was head priest at the
          time. I saw entries from grandmother Nel, and from her brother
          Ashur-Dan-Pilesh before her. I had been told grandfather Dan had
          died before I was born, but no one, not even grandmother Nel had
          told me how. Here, in the family's secret journal, I learned the
          truth. Grandmother Nel didn't just take the priesthood from
          grandfather Dan, she killed him for it. I read her entries about
          the incident, imagining her voice speaking the words, trying to
          piece together her motivations from the terse language. She wrote
          about having him killed like it had to happen, like it was the
          only way to survive. That couldn't be true, could it? I flipped
          farther back through the journal.
            The waking bells sounded out, and I realized I had been reading
          through the entire nighttime sleep. The family would be
          waking--mother and father would expect me to be in my bed. I had
          skimmed sections of the journal going all the way back to
          Sarru-Gin himself--my great-grandfather going back five
          generations, the founder of our colony, and the chosen champion
          of Meteora. There was one thing I needed before I would leave.
          Many of the priests, great-grandfather included, mentioned
          something they called the Outcomes. I closed the tome and
          shuffled around the room hurriedly, looking for the phrase. I
          found a small booklet with the word Outcomes written on it in
          unceremonious shorthand. Without opening it, I put it in the
          breast pocket of my night-robes, and rushed back out into the
          open air.

            Father was in the kitchen when I arrived back at the family
          apartments.
            "Up already?" He asked.
            "I did not sleep well," I said, which was not entirely untrue,
          since I had slept not at all.
            "We find ourselves in hard times," he said. "Perhaps the
          hardest the priesthood has had to face since we left the
          star-home, guided by Meteora to cleanse the planet."
            He looked like he wanted to say more, so I only nodded.
            "Sar-Il, I'm afraid I may have been too dismissive of you in
          the night-turn eve. Come with me to meet with the other priests.
          You will see we are doing more than waiting for the drought to
          swallow us."
            Relief washed over me like a cool bath. father was listening to
          me after all, and I wanted desperately to know what the
          priesthood had been doing these past few weeks, what his journal
          entries had meant about leaving the valley to find water. I felt
          the impression of the booklet at my breast. I willed the other,
          newer questions out of my mind; questions about great-grandfather
          Sarru-Gin, the first priest of Meteora, questions about the
          go-rythms and about the numbers called the Outcomes. I had spent
          the night feeling like a weak flame undulating in the wind, about
          to go out at any moment. Now I hoped that feeling had been
          nothing but dreamlike terror.
            I followed father out into a glade at the very edge of the
          temple grounds. Here were rock gardens that the initiated priests
          used for private meetings and to hold some sacred artifacts and
          texts--much like the one I currently hid secret in my
          night-robes. Many of the family priests were already there, and
          looked at me oddly as we entered.
            "My son would join us today, to hear some of what the
          priesthood does," he said.
            "Is this really appropriate?" I turned to see the speaker was
          uncle Ili.
            "I know he is not yet initiated," father responded, "but the
          trouble we find ourselves in is once in a lifetime, and he will
          need the experience if he is to succeed me."
            "If indeed," said uncle Ili. Father ignored him.
            "What news, Inya-Esh."
            "We confirmed the result divined by your directions," Aunt Inya
          said. "There is indeed a starfall imminent in the valley to the
          north. There is time for a convoy to be sent, and if we are
          lucky, the reservoir dug by Great One Ashur-Dan-Pilesh 20 years
          ago is still intact."
            I did my best to keep the expression on my face even, I wanted
          to belong here.
	"What of the payload." Father said.
            "More than enough. And another starfall will likely run the
          same course in two months. But there is no telling how much we
          can store, or whether the reservoir has become toxic."
            "Still, it is something. Well done."
            "The problem remains," Uncle Ili said, "what to do about
          transport." He looked at me, as if unsure how candidly to speak
          in my presence. Cousin Mubal sat at his side, fidgeting with his
          fingernails. "Grandfather Ashur-Dan-Pilesh was cunning, but he
          was a fool to think he would go unnoticed. The convoys were
          discovered, and it was only because of the skill of our dear
          mother that the valley-folk discovered nothing."
            "We will be more careful."
            "Are you a fool too?" uncle Ili said, an ironic smile curling
          over his face the way a grub curls in on itself when picked from
          the dirt.
            "Speak rightly to Great One Ashur-Pola-Ishkun," Aunt Inya said.
          "You may be brothers, but even among family, we must maintain
          order."
            "Of course, cousin," he said, performing a bigger bow than
          seemed necessary. "I mean only to say that we need more than to
          be careful. You know the Outcomes as well as I. If anyone
          discovers the source of the water, we risk splintering. Kin, it
          has already been too long without telling the townfolk about the
          divination. The longer we wait, the more suspicious they will
          become about an explanation we give them."
            Sounds of affirmation sprung up here and there amoung the
          priests. Father looked uneasily around.
            "They may be suspicious anyway," father said. "Six months is a
          long time for the goddess to be angry. Even if they do take
          whatever medicine you ask them to swallow, the loss of life would
          put the colony back decades. We are already behind schedule as it
          is."
            "Pah! Schedule!" Uncle Ili threw his hands up. "The last thing
          we need is more people in that town. They grow more suspicious
          and hard to contain with every generation as is."
            "Inya-Esh," father said, after the chatter had died down.
          "Could the fountain at the center of the courtyard be fed via
          pipes from a point out of sight, higher on the mountain maybe?"
            "Perhaps. What are you thinking?"
            "As long as we have water, suspicion can only be raised around
          how it arrived. If we can create the appearance of a miracle--"
            "Then we don't need to hide the abundance!"
            "Clever," uncle Ili said, "but don't take it personally if we
          prepare for alternative solutions. The family must come first,
          you know."
            "Yes," father said. "But so long as I'm high priest, I will not
          wait as our people die of thirst."
            Just then, an enormous crack like an earthquake sounded out. We
          all looked up, familiar with the sound of a starfall. For a
          moment, I felt like I was waking from a bad dream--that
          everything in my world still made sense as it had a mere month
          ago.  Maybe my solo articulations of the divination had been
          faulty somehow, maybe the family were all worrying for nothing,
          and Meteora had answered our prayers. But when I looked up, it
          was not a shower of little stars, the kind that brought ice which
          sublimated into rain-bringing clouds. Instead, a single ray of
          fire shot quickly across the sky, turning the sky a strange blue
          color I had never seen before, and roared as it streamed towards
          the north mountains--a scream from a god demanding to be heard.

            "A black star." I heard an uncle mutter, expelling the words
          from his bearded mouth, as if hoping to rid himself of the taste
          of it.
            "The valley-folk will have seen it. You know what this means,
          Pola-Ish," aunt Inya said to father.
            "Poorly timed," uncle Ili said, casting his eyes downward. "The
          valley-folk tell stories of the last black star. It was closely
          associated with uncle Dan-Pil's drought, just like the one we
          find ourselves in now. I suppose we should hope they have
          forgotten how we explained that omen to their ancestors."
            Father said nothing.
            "Inya, prepare to leave for the north valley at day-turn morn.
          Wrap your heads well and keep under the moss-trees."
            Aunt Inya began to protest. "But what about--"
            "I will handle the black star," father said sternly, and then
          turned to leave the garden. I followed him out, but he didn't
          look at me, though I desperately sought some sign of what to do
          with myself. I was scared. I didn't fully understand the weight
          of the situation--I knew the black star only as the fabled sign
          of Meteora's rage.
            I followed him all the way back to the apartments, where mother
          stood in the doorway, cradling her swollen belly with one arm.
          The look on her face only increased my terror. She and father
          embraced wordlessly. I could hear my own heart beating through my
          night-robes.
            "What will happen, father?" I said when I couldn't wait any
          longer.
            He released mother, and tears stuck strands of hair to her
          cheeks.
            "I will keep you safe, Sar-Il," he said.
            "Is Meteora upset with us?" I asked.
            He grabbed my shoulders, his hands large but tender. "I'm sorry
          that I don't have time to explain everything. Maybe it was a
          mistake to bring you to the meeting today."
            "Surely, we will tell the town about the drought now, like
          uncle Ili said?"
            Father searched for words, I hated that he didn't think I could
          understand. The whole family was clearly in danger, I wanted to
          help and he wouldn't let me.
            "We can't, not before your aunt Inya returns with water."
            "So you can lie to them about a miracle?" I said, almost
          shouting. My face felt hot.
            "The truth is dangerous."
            "The truth is the truth." I said and stormed off towards my
          room.
            From under my bedroll I pulled out the book of Outcomes. If
          father wouldn't tell me what was going on, I would learn it from
          great-grandfather instead. I left out the back way, and made for
          the mountain pass.

            The book of Outcomes began with a preface from
          great-grandfather Sarru-Gin, who in this book called himself
          Saul. I learned that he had lived on the star-home--which he
          called the Starship Naraja--and had a job that was something like
          what father always said the priesthood did: he kept people in
          order.
            There were details about something great-grandfather referred
          to as 'mathematics' which seemed oddly similar to the go-rhythms,
          only they could be done without instruments at all, using strange
          arcane symbols and letters on paper. Then, he declared the
          intention of this text. The toxic air on Risha, he said, would
          not be purified for 20,000 years. The little stars which brought
          water were actually space-rocks, intentionally cast down from
          their place millions of miles away by the star-home
          Naraja--hundreds of thousands of them. Using his mathematics,
          great-grandfather spent page upon page outlining the relative
          likelihoods of our  survival on this baneful planet. There were
          long sentences of symbols and numbers that repeated dozens of
          times in slight variations, each summarized by an understated
          byline:

               If non-acidic aquifers form in deep sediment: 67%


               If implanted religion survives first ten generations: 65%


               If second settlement is formed before tenth generation: 26%


               If second settlement is formed after tenth generation: 47%

            When I first took the book, I had hoped to find instructions
          for some prayer or spell that would end the drought. But as I
          finished reading, I realized with dread that great-grandfather
          had not been any different from us. He had been totally helpless
          against the forces of this cruel place. He had a supreme ability
          to foretell the weather--but that was all. If that forecast was
          bad, there was nothing to be done.
            With this realization, others came too. I thought about the
          holy days we celebrate, like the yearly measurement of the karma
          in the air. The prospect of seeing the world improved once filled
          me with hope. Now the bleak reality of the holiday's meaning
          occurred to me: I would live all my life with an orange sky whose
          sun burned my skin, oceans too acidic to swim in, and air whose
          latent evil kept me from being able to run or exert myself for
          more than a few minutes. And so would my children, and my
          children's children--if I had any offspring to speak of. I also
          thought about the lies and plans of father, uncle Ili, and the
          other priests of our family. They were intentionally hiding the
          truth from the valley-folk. The entirety of the priesthood was a
          lie. Meteora didn't listen to anything we did or said, and the
          only thing we could do was divine the next starfall--and even
          that we did by lying.
            I heard sounds, voices, coming down the mountain path. I had
          decided that if no one else would tell the valley-folk about the
          drought, and about the lies of the priesthood, then I would. I
          hadn't thought they'd come after me so soon.
            "He had his chance," one voice said, and I realized it was
          Uncle Ili's. "Now we have ours."
            I thought about hiding in the brush, but they were too close,
          and noticed me. As they approached, I saw that the other figure
          was cousin Mubal. He looked at me with an expression I couldn't
          read, but seemed to be seeking something in me.
            "Ah, nephew," uncle Ili said. "Is your father looking for me."
             "You want to tell them, right?" I said.
            He looked at his son, who shrugged.
            "The people of Irkallu valley. You wanted to tell them about
          the drought."
            "Thats right. And what do you want, nephew."
            "To tell the truth." I said.
            Cousin Mubal smiled, and walked up to hug me by the shoulder.
          "Well, that settles it then, doesn't it."
            "Are you feeling brave?" He asked me. And for once, I felt like
          I was not being treated like a child.

            I got to the town just as everyone was waking from their
          daytime sleep. Eve was beginning, but the sunlight was still
          strong, the sky was the color of honey. I walked through the huts
          and fields of purple and green sprites looking for Kiem. I found
          him laying under a tree, splayed out in his brown day-turn linen.
            "Sin-Sar-Ilani?" he said when I approached.
            "Kiem, my friend. I must speak to your father."
            He got up with great effort. I could hear him panting. I was
          afraid to see what he looked like under the wrappings.
            "What is it? He's gone to speak to the other farmers about the
          black-star."
            "Then we must be quick. Take me to them."
            I followed Kiem through the dusty streets, the orange sky
          turning black above us, until we reached the longhouse. I could
          already hear the din of arguments inside. Several heads turned
          when we entered, and Kiem called to his father to introduce me.
            "Great One," Kiem's father said. "We were beginning to worry as
          we have not received word about the black star from the holy
          family."
            "I am sorry you have had to wait. And I am not a Great One. Not
          yet, at least." I said. "I'm afraid I come bearing ill news. But
          you deserve to hear it."
            I walked up to the front of the room, and the crowd gave way as
          I walked through them. I looked out at their scared, gaunt faces.
          I tried my best to exude calm, like father did. Except I didn't
          want to be like father, did I? I pushed the thought from my mind,
          and cleared my throat.
            "Starfall rain is still some four months away." I said, and
          watched as the room immediately burst into commotion.
            "When was the divination done?" someone shouted.  "Why didn't
          they tell us?" said another.
            "The priesthood has known of the drought for some time. I am
          sorry that you were lied to. But I am here to atone for that sin.
          There is water to the north of the mountains, we can send convoys
          for water there, or everyone could relocate there until the
          drought is over."
            "Leave our homes?" Kiem said. He had removed his head-wrapping.
          He looked gaunt, the way grandmother Nel had looked before she
          died. Many of the valley-folk looked just as bad.
            "Just temporarily." I said. There was a crushing weight in my
          chest seeing the effects of my family's lies.
            "Why would this happen?" Kiem's father asked. "We pray for
          rain, we have given all our best livestock as offering. What does
          Meteora ask of us."
            "It's the black star." Someone else said. "Meteora sends us her
          rage. The boy tells us the priests have lied, she sent us the
          omen so we would discover the truth. They have lost her favor!"
            Roars of assent rang out in the longhouse. I tried to raise my
          voice and respond, but they wouldn't hear me. I looked at Kiem,
          he eyed me warily, like he wasn't sure who I was.
            "Please. I can save you."
            "That you can, boy." Kiem's father grabbed me, and dragged me
          out of the longhouse. The sun was setting. I watched in horror as
          the other valley-folk began to gather beyond Kiem's father, armed
          with poles, knives, and torches.
            "If Meteora has sent us a black star," Kiem's father said to
          the crowd, "Then we must obey her call!"

            They dragged me, weeping, through the dark mountain trail up to
          the temple gates. I cast my eyes on the ground, unable to face my
          father and my whole family when they realized what I had done.
          But to my surprise, the gates opened for the villagers as they
          arrived, yelling curses. Inside, the priests were arrayed in
          lines leading to the altar-stage, as they would do for any
          ordinary visit--each holding a small lantern lighting the way to
          the temple stage. On the stage, my father sat in a ceremonial
          position, and above him on either side, were cousin Mubal and
          uncle Ili.
            The men of Irkallu valley were armed with farming instruments,
          and didn't seem to understand the warm welcome. I reflexively
          tried to back away from the temple, but Kiem's father held me
          firm by the elbow. He made me walk with them into the center of
          the temple grounds. I looked back at Kiem, trailing behind
          meekly. He avoided my gaze.
            Uncle Ili, bade the people to approach. And when he had their
          attention, apologized for having let me come to them first.
            "Thank you for bringing back the child. I'm not sure what he
          told you, but know that he likely sought to protect his father
          from the consequences of his crimes--most likely all that he told
          you was untrue. But worry not, we have discovered his father's
          crimes, and justice will be done."
            Murmurs from the crowd. "So the black star," the man holding me
          said, "it is true?"
            "Yes, lady Meteora has not rightly received her blessings, my
          brother kept them for himself. It was only when she sent her
          black star that we became suspicious of the many weeks without
          starfall, and realized the cause. On behalf of our entire family,
          I humble apologize for the strife my brother has caused you."
            Uncle Ili bowed deeply. The valley-folk eyed each other, unsure
          how to respond.
            "Liars!" I screamed, but Kiem's father shook me violently, and
          it was all I could do to keep breathing.
            "What will you do, then, priest." Kiem's father said.
            "Meteora must have her justice." Uncle Ili said, "and so must
          you, I assume."
            To that, the crowd jeered. One of my uncles came out from the
          back of the temple stage with a divine artifact I had never seen
          before: a huge glimmering axe of star-home metal. I closed my
          eyes, and screamed until my throat was sore.
            Once my father's head was separated from his shoulders, uncle
          Ili led the people in a quiet prayer. His voice became
          conspiratorial, and he bade them return to the village, and tell
          their families what happened here, and to wait patiently for
          Meteora to respond.  It worked. They left, to the sound of the
          go-rhythm players--minus my sitar--hard at work divining the next
          starfall. They knew, as well as I did, that the result would be
          the same as it has been for two months.
            Once the priesthood families were alone, and the gate closed,
          The priests all rushed to uncle Ili, relieved. Father's body lay
          right beside them, and they sighed with satisfaction. Mother came
          rushing out of the nearby apartments, waddling with the weight of
          her stomach, and felt at my forehead and neck, checking for
          bruises and cuts.
            "My son. My foolish, tenderhearted son," she said. I felt numb.
          I wished she sounded more angry with me.
            "Maybe I should thank you," a voice said from behind me. I
          turned to see cousin Mubal. "My father is head priest now, and
          you've given us a good story to explain why the rains won't come
          for so long this year. We were worried the plan your father made
          wouldn't work. He was sure the village wouldn't resort to
          violence. He thought they would accept it if we told them there
          were sinners among them in need of a cleansing ritual, and then
          reveal a miracle at the courtyard fountain."
            I said nothing, only headed back to our apartments. I felt
          hollow inside. Mother sat me down at the table and then slowly
          lowered herself to the mat floor. Looking at her, I thought about
          my unborn brother or sister, who would have to grow up without
          knowing our father, and that it would be because of me. We were
          silent for a long time then. I kept seeing that look on his face,
          the resignation in his eyes--or was it resolve? After some time,
          my mother spoke.
            "The family has been at war for quite some time," she said.
            "War?" It was not a word I had heard used outside of stories of
          the homeworld. War was something that could only happen between
          armies, I had thought.
            "Over interpretation of your great-grandfather's work. We came
          to Risha early because of revolt on the star-home. But the work
          of the family as priests was only supposed to be temporary.
          'Scaffolding for the new civilization,' your great-grandfather
          called it. But the family lost trust in the Outcomes, they
          worried that if the family splintered, if new settlements were
          allowed to form, that it would cost them their comfort here. Your
          father was different. He was trying to trick the family into
          settling in the north valley. He was slowly gaining support, too.
          Then the black star ruined everything."
            "No. I ruined everything." I said, my voice hoarse.
            "No, Sar-Il. He saved you, so that you could continue his
          work," she said.
            I looked at my mother's face. I saw for the first time what I
          had overlooked for so long. She had understood the precariousness
          of our position, how easily we could be killed, how easily our
          whole civilization could crumble. And yet, she had hope enough
          left to have children. They both had.
            "Let me show you something," she said. I helped her up and we
          made for the pack patio, facing the mountain.  A handcart sat
          hidden among the moss-trees.
            "When the black star came, your father saw a small piece land
          just to the north. He had your aunt Inya recover it in secret and
          sent it back with part of her convoy."
            Mother removed the canvas covering, revealing a warped box of
          star-home metal with one face torn off. Inside, there were lights
          and colors like I'd never seen before, except in the basement
          sanctum of the priesthood, where I had stolen the book of
          Outcomes. There were sounds too, like the constant sound of a
          river or a crackling flame, and I could swear I heard the faint
          voices. Among the latticework of unintelligible devices and
          instruments, I saw a plaque with letters carved into it. They
          spelled out:

               NARAJA


               I put my sitar on the stack of metal devices in the handcart,
          then began my journey northward through the mountains, towards
          the north valley. 36% had been the chance of survival for
          founding a second settlement too early. But there was another
          prediction a few pages away:
            	Chance of survival if Naraja abandoned, and additional wave of
          settlers arrive on Risha before tenth generation: 70%
            	The black star had brought with it new settlers--I had spoken
          with some of them on one of the star-home devices. They were
          frightened, and alone. I could do the go-rythms by hand, but I
          would show them how to play them on sitar anyway--as father had
          taught me. If all goes well, I could return to Irkallu with the
          gift of water. I could save Kiem, and then bring some of them
          with me and mother over into a north Valley. Even though they had
          turned on me, and had cheered as  father died, I didn't blame the
          valley-folk. The 'civilizational scaffolding' of the priesthood
          was nearing the end of it's time on Risha. I would make sure of
          that. Finally, there was more to be done than standing still and
          praying for rain.
