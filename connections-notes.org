* Story outline
Foster is a middle of the road guy, just trying to survive, who has to deal with turning off the social media clone of his dead twin sister, Sarah. He figures out the only way to do it is to have someone else go in for him, and he chooses her college ex-boyfriend Brad, but to ask him, he has to sell his body to a high-tech labor camp while he is asleep. In the game, he flounders but manages to ask Brad, only for Brad to misunderstand him, and think he wants to take Brad to court for something he did—which foster has no memory of. Brad ices Foster out, who begins to have aches and pains every day from the labor his body has been at, and soon has legal fees that fully put him under. He thinks there is no way out, but he finally understands usefulness of the disassociation he learned in the simulation game, and resigns to an existence away from the world, and he pays for his sister’s second self to continue working, just for him personally.
